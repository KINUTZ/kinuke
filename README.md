A platform based on KINU ideas


WHAT IS KINU? 
  We are a Social Enterprise with the mission of concentrating, growing and 
  accelerating the Tanzanian tech and social landscape.

WHY KINU?
1. The Tanzanian tech scene needs to be brought together to form a community, 
	develop a culture of co-creation and innovation which will become the catalyst for growth and capacity building.
2. A collaborative space is needed to enable the community to participate into the 
	co-creation process and make a joint effort to generate new solutions.
3. We must establish the environment needed to ensure that the next generation of 
	African innovators has the freedom to build products services which will reach out to the rest of the world.
4. By concentrating technology innovators that are building businesses in specific areas of interest,
	we make it easier and more likely for financiers such as venture capitalists, 
	angel investors or profit / non-profit driven corporations to find them and their products and services.
5. Build an ecosystem that facilitates transfer of knowledge and allows people to feed off each othersâ€™ skills and expertise, 
	for a symbiotic relationship that benefits everyone.
